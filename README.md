Download the APK : [Installable APK](https://github.com/ishraqe/restaurant/raw/master/apk/app-release.apk)



## Built With
 - [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
 - [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)


This is my second application built with react native. I built this to check out social authentication and google map's. For this app stores so little data so i used  [AsyncStorage](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/asyncstorage.html). 

I would really appricate any suggestions, feedback, PRs and Issues.


## Walkthrough

In Singn in and Sign Up i [React native Facebook Sdk](https://github.com/facebook/react-native-fbsdk) and [React native Google SignIn](https://github.com/devfd/react-native-google-signin)  combining with Redux state control. 

Upon successful sign in or sign up, the user will be directed to the timeline page. These page are created using the [React native router flux](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux). 
Chossing [React native router flux](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux) was a tricky decision. 

The Home View is consists of Four tabs -

 - Home
 - Search
 - Map 
 - Bookmark 
 
These are swipeable tabs that are created by using the library [React native router flux](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux). 

The top navigation bar comes also with it. There is also a drawer or side bar present there.  It consists of users name, image , location and Log out button. 


The "Home" component is a basically [Flat list](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/flatlist.html).  All the data are coming from [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/). 

The next "Map" component built with [React Native Maps](https://github.com/react-community/react-native-maps).

In and unfortunate event i didn't found any restaurants image, menu and menu image. So i used some dummy contents for them. 

 

### Debugging & crash-reporting:

Debugging of was pretty straight forward using the built in debug option. Rather than this i used [React native debugger](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger), which gives me more flexibilty of debugging and waching over redux state. 

Upon installing the app i had faced some issues that caused the app crash and my bust my head of. By searching and asking on different communities i found some pretty good crash report tools. Among them i found love in [bugsnag](https://www.bugsnag.com/). They came up with some pretty good well formatted crash report.
